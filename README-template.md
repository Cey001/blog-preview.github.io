## My process

I built this using the desktop-first approach, then i use the media query to make it responsive for any mobile device.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### Continued development

I really feel i can improve more on how to make my websites more responsive, considering how i find media-queries difficult to use. But i believe i just need to put in more work
